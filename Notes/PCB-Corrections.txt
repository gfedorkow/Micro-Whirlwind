** Main PCB
The illuminated push switch has a mechanical key for orientation that I missed completely; add it!

Show the push buttons as being on the back of the board
move the Power button out of the way of the LCD HDMI

Change the green power LED resistor from 1K to 6.8K to 22K
Change the red power LED resistor to xxK

Correct hole sizes for SW25 on-off-on toggle sw
Ground switch SW-25 frame
Ground the mounting screw holes for ESD resistance
Ground the potentiometer frames

Correct footprint for 10-pin I2C address-fixer  (arghhh!)

Unscramble SCL/SDA pins on TCA key scanner schematic
Add pullups to 3.3V on the I2C output of the address-fixer
Add more test points for stuff like the I2C bus(ses), 3.3V supply, TCA chip with hidden pins, etc

Pins on the RCA jacks are Backwards!

Pin 4 on FF2 Red D15B diode didn't get routed!

(The IsGunOn2 pin got re-used?  Should be disconnected on Rainer's board?)

Disconnect +5V from J2 16-pin connector

The Audio Click pins on the analog page aren't connected to anything!


Note pin conflict:

** Dress Panel
enlarge the round cutouts for push buttons
Move the MAR label
Add 0..15 bit numbers
Add Op-Code / Operand markers to PAR (in very small print!)
Correct horizontal positioning of LCD cutout
